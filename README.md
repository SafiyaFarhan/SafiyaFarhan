# **Safiya Farhan | Aspiring Data Engineer & Analyst**
**A-Levels Student (Math, Stats, CS, Physics) | Building in Public | Pakistan**  

*(No fluff—just real progress, real skills, real struggles.)*  

---  

### **Current Skills (Proven, Not Claimed)**  
✅ **SQL** – Building queries, databases (see my **Note-Taking App** below)  
✅ **Python** – GUI development, scripting (CS50 in progress)  
✅ **Data Tools** – Pandas (learning), Excel (basic)  
✅ **Git/GitHub** – Actively learning version control  

*(I only list what I’ve actually built—no fake expertise.)*

### **Recent Projects (Small but Real)**  

#### **1. Python + SQL Note-Taking App (GUI + Database)**  
- **Tech Used:** `Python (Tkinter)`, `SQLite`  
- **What It Does:** Lets users save/search notes in a local database.  
- **Why It Matters:** My **first full-stack mini-project**—proves I can connect code to data.  
- **[🔗 View Code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E10KqjoCM2Ls4gOc_qeW8XTFdsn_809w?usp=drive_link)** *(Link repo when ready!)*  

#### **2. SQL Mastery (Ongoing)**  
- Learning SQL in a Udemy SQL Masterclass course 
- Practicing **30+ real-world queries** (joins, subqueries, optimizations).  
- Will post solutions on GitHub + LinkedIn.  

#### **3. CS50 (Harvard) – In Progress**  
- Learning **Python, Algorithms, Data Structures**.  
- Will upload problem sets to GitHub.

### **2025 Goals (Transparent Timeline)**  
✔ **Finish Google Data Analytics Cert** *(Started July 2024)*  
✔ **Build 3 More Mini-Projects** (SQL + Python)  
✔ **Kaggle: Complete 1 Dataset Analysis**  
✔ **GitHub: 50+ Commits by December** *(Tracking publicly!)*

### **Where I’m Struggling (And Learning)**  
- **Git/GitHub:** Still learning branches, PRs, and workflows.  
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas/Matplotlib are next after CS50.  
- **Time Management:** Balancing A-Levels + coding.  

*(Progress > perfection. I’m documenting the messy middle.)*
